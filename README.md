# Epsilon point control of the smooth differential drive model

This is repo shows an example of epsilon point control of the smooth differential drive model. The controller is implemented in python and simulations are done in three forms. The first is a basic integration simulation to show that the system is working as expected. The second is a matplotlib animation of the system. The third is a simulation in gazebo and ROS2.

## Introduction

The unicycle model is a common state space representation to express a differential drive robot.
The unicycle model state consists of its x and y positions $x_1, \, x_2$ it's orientation $\phi$,
it's forward velocity $\upsilon$ and it angular velocity $\omega$ This state expressed in vector form is then

```math
x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\\ \phi\\ \upsilon\\ \omega\end{bmatrix}$
```

The dynamics of this system are then defined by $\frac{d}{dx}$ which are expressed by

```math
\dot{x} = \begin{bmatrix}\upsilon\cos{\phi}\\  \upsilon \sin{\phi}\\ \omega \\ a \\ \alpha \end{bmatrix}
```

## Why epsilon point control

The difficulty with controlling this system is that it contains what is called "non-holonomic" constraints which are non integratable constraints.
The constraint with this system is that it cannot move orthogonal to orientation.
To alleviate this we utilize something called epsilon point control.
This basic idea is that if a robot is traveling on a path there is a point $\epsilon$ away that does not have that constraint. So instead of trying to control the robots position we control the position of this point.

## Math (You can skip this if you want but it is cool!)

### Definition of epsilon state

We can define the point that is $\epsilon$ away as $y_\epsilon$.

```math
y_\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix} + \epsilon \begin{bmatrix}\cos{\phi}\\\sin{\phi}\end{bmatrix}
```

To get the full state we must also take the first and second derivatives of $y_\epsilon$.

```math
R_{\epsilon} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\phi} & - \epsilon\sin{\phi} \\ \sin{\phi} & \epsilon{\cos{\phi}}\end{bmatrix}, \chi_\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & - \epsilon\omega \\ \epsilon\omega & 0  \end{bmatrix}, \, \bar{a} = \begin{bmatrix}a\\ \alpha\end{bmatrix}, \, \bar{\upsilon} = \begin{bmatrix}\upsilon\\ \omega\end{bmatrix}
```

```math
\dot{y}_\epsilon = R_{\epsilon}\bar{\upsilon}, \, \ddot{y}_\epsilon = R_{\epsilon} \chi_\epsilon\bar{\upsilon} + R_{\epsilon}\bar{a}$
```

### Feedback linearization

$\ddot{y}_\epsilon$ is a function of $\bar{a}$ which is the control inputs of the system so solving for this will give us the control inputs that will allow us to follow a path.

```math
\bar{a} = R_{\epsilon}^{-1}(\ddot{y}_\epsilon - R_{\epsilon} \chi_\epsilon\bar{\upsilon})$$
```

using this we can create an feed back linearized system.

```math
\begin{bmatrix}\dot{y}_\epsilon \\ \ddot{y}_\epsilon\end{bmatrix} = Ay + Bu, \text{ where } y = \begin{bmatrix}y_\epsilon \\ \dot{y}_\epsilon \end{bmatrix}
```

```math
\dot{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}y + \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
1 & 0\\
0 & 1\end{bmatrix}u
```

### Finding control gains for the system

Now that we have a linearized system we can find the control gains for the system. This can be done with either pole placement or LQR. For this I used LQR but since there is no cost associated with system states the Q and R matrices are identity matrices.

$$k = lqr(A,B,Q,R)\, \text{ where } Q = diag([1,1,1,1]), \, R = diag([1,1])$$

The control input for the linearized system is then

$$ u_y = u_{ff} - k (y - y_{des})$$

where $u_{ff}$ is $\ddot{y}_\epsilon$ and $y_{des}$ is the desired state of the system.

This control can then be converted to the control for the unicycle model by the following equations.

$$\begin{bmatrix}a\\ \alpha\end{bmatrix} = R_{\epsilon}^{-1} u_y - \hat{\omega}\bar{v}$$

### Converting Unicycle to Smooth Differential Drive

The unicycle model is not the most realistic model of a differential drive robot. In reality we need to control the rotation for each of the robots wheels. The smooth differential drive model is similar to the unicycle model but just swaps the velocity terms for left and right wheel velocities. The smooth differential drive model is defined by the following equations.

 $$
 \dot{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{r}{2}(w_r+w_t)\cos(\theta)\\
        \frac{r}{2}(w_r+w_t)\sin{\theta}\\
        \frac{r}{L}(w_r-w_l)\\
        u_r\\
        u_l
    \end{bmatrix}, \, \begin{bmatrix}
        v = \frac{r}{2}(w_r + w_)\\
        w = \frac{r}{L}(w_r-w_l)
    \end{bmatrix}
    ,\, x = \begin{bmatrix}
        q_1\\
        q_2\\
        \theta\\
        w_r\\
        w_l
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

The conversion can be done by solving for the setting $u_r$ and $u_l$ equal to the derivative of the second vector $v$ and $w$ above and solving for $u_r$ and $u_l$.

Skipping some algebra the control inputs for the smooth differential drive model are

$$u_r = \frac{a}{r} - \frac{L}{2r}\alpha, \, u_l = \frac{a}{r} + \frac{L}{2r}\alpha$$

## Trajectory tracking

Trajectory tracking is done by defining the desired state of the $y_\epsilon$ system and finding its first and second derivatives. For this simulation I choose the trajectory to be

```math
y = \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\sin{t}\\t\end{bmatrix}
```

## Basic Integration Simulation

Before using a simulation of the system a basic integration simulation was done to make sure that the system was working as expected. The results of this simulation are shown below.

This is shows that behavior of the system is as expected as time goes on the trajectory converges.

## MatPlotLib Animation

Next i created a basic animation using matplotlib where I utilize the state of the integrated system to move an arrow around on a blank plot. The results of this simulation are shown below.

A little more interesting than a plot but still not very exciting.

## Gazebo and ROS2 Simulation

Next I took the controller code and implemented into the ROS2 framework and simulated it in gazebo. I used a basic turtle bot and recalulated the forward and angular velocity of the turtle bot using the smooth differential drive model and published this on the cmd_vel topic. The results of this simulation are shown below.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project and I learned a lot about differential drive robots and how to control them. I also learned a lot about ROS2 and gazebo. I think that this is a good way to control a differential drive robot and I think that it would be interesting to see how this would work on a real robot.
